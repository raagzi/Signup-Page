# Signup-Page
In this code snippet, we have a basic signup page component in React. The useState hook is used to manage the form data, which includes fields for name, email, and password. The handleChange function updates the form data as the user types in the input fields. The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted, where you can send a signup request to the server, handle user registration, and perform any necessary actions.

This code assumes that you have set up a server using Express.js and have an appropriate route for handling the signup request on the backend. Additionally, you'll need to handle password hashing, validation, and any additional fields required for user registration.

Remember to customize and adapt this code to fit your specific signup requirements, such as implementing form validation, integrating with a backend API, and handling signup responses accordingly.
